## Introduction

The ability to perform arithmetic operations on unsigned 32-bit integers is crucial in many applications, especially in fields like computer graphics, network programming, and data processing. This repository provides a straightforward implementation for adding two such integers. 

## Installation

To get started, you can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/SurateeChaimted/number-uint32-base-add/releases) section. Make sure to download the appropriate file for your environment and follow the instructions to execute it.

### Prerequisites

Before using this library, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (for JavaScript)
- A C compiler (for C implementation)

## Usage

### JavaScript

To use the library in a JavaScript environment, simply require the module:

```javascript
const addUint32 = require('number-uint32-base-add');
const result = addUint32(4294967295, 1);
console.log(result); // Output: 0
```

### C

For the C implementation, include the header file and call the function:

```c
#include "add_uint32.h"

int main() {
    uint32_t result = add_uint32(4294967295, 1);
    printf("%u\n", result); // Output: 0
    return 0;
}
```

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use the library effectively.

### Example 1: Adding Two Small Numbers

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const result = addUint32(10, 20);
console.log(result); // Output: 30
```

**C:**

```c
uint32_t result = add_uint32(10, 20);
printf("%u\n", result); // Output: 30
```

### Example 2: Adding Maximum Values

When you add two maximum unsigned 32-bit integers, the result wraps around.

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const result = addUint32(4294967295, 4294967295);
console.log(result); // Output: 4294967294
```

**C:**

```c
uint32_t result = add_uint32(4294967295, 4294967295);
printf("%u\n", result); // Output: 4294967294
```

## API Reference

### `addUint32(a, b)`

- **Parameters**
  - `a` (uint32): The first unsigned 32-bit integer.
  - `b` (uint32): The second unsigned 32-bit integer.

- **Returns**
  - (uint32): The sum of `a` and `b`, wrapped around if it exceeds the maximum value.

### Error Handling

This library does not throw errors for overflow. Instead, it wraps around as per the behavior of unsigned integers in C and JavaScript.
